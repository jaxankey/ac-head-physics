This head physics engine requires CSP v0.2.0 or later.

Currently you cannot just drag this zip file onto 
Content Manager. To install this, ensure NeckFX
is enabled in Content Manager:

  Settings -> Custom Shaders Patch -> NeckFX 

then extract the 

"ac-head-physics" folder into:

  assettocorsa\extension\lua\cockpit-camera

so that the "ac-head-physics" folder is sitting 
next to the "default" folder. Then, restart 
Content Manager, go back to

  Settings -> Custom Shaders Patch -> NeckFX 

then make sure "Replace original CSP behavior" is 
"Active", and select the script "ac-head-physics" 
(instead of "default") on the right.

If you want access to all the script's settings 
within Content Manager (note you can adjust these 
while the game is running!), you may need to get 
the latest untested Content Manager version in:

  Settings -> Content Manager -> Testing access
