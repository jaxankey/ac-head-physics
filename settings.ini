; Head Physics Settings

; Head tilting forward
PITCH_ENABLED   = 1;   Pitch Physics (Enables pitch-axis inertia and dynamics [i.e., "nodding" motion].);   1 or 0
PITCH_SCALE     = 1;   Car Pitch Tracking (How much your head follows the car orientation [100%] rather than the horizon [0%].); from 0.0 to 1.0, perc.; only with PITCH_ENABLED

A real head will probably have damping around 0.85-0.95, and a drunk head will have a lower value, but setting this to 1 kills all oscillations and probably conveys the most reliable information about the car.); from 0 to 2, round to 0.01; only with PITCH_ENABLED

; Head following the car as it turns
; This let's the car slightly turn under your head initially

; you want to kill yawbbles.
