[GLOBAL ADJUSTMENTS]

FREQUENCY_SCALE = 1; Stiffness Multiplier (Shortcut to simultaneously rescale all six stiffness settings. Setting this to 1 means no adjustment to the values below [multiply by 1], larger numbers make your head more locked to the car, and smaller numbers make your head more floppy, which helps stabilize your vision of the road as the car jitters around you. Setting this to zero is pretty funny, as it makes your head a free-floating mass within the limits specified below :]. See individual stiffness settings for more information about what this means. Note also that the total frequency is limited to 10 Hz, because weird artifacts appear [as they should] when the frequency approaches the physics engine framerate.); from 0 to 5, round to 0.05 
DAMPING_SCALE   = 0.75; Damping Multiplier (Shortcut to simultaneously rescale all six damping settings.
