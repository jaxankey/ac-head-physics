[SETTINGS]
; AC HEAD PHYSICS

[GLOBAL ADJUSTMENTS]

GLOBAL_FREQUENCY_SCALE = 1; Global Stiffness Multiplier (Shortcut to simultaneously rescale all six stiffness settings. Setting this to 1 means no adjustment to the values below [multiply by 1], larger numbers make your head more locked to the car, and smaller numbers make your head more floppy, which helps stabilize your vision of the road as the car jitters around you. Setting this to zero is pretty funny, as it makes your head a free-floating mass within the limits specified below :]. See individual stiffness settings for more information. Note also that the total frequency is limited to 10 Hz, because weird artifacts appear [as they should] when the frequency approaches the physics engine framerate.); from 0 to 5, round to 0.05 
GLOBAL_DAMPING_SCALE   = 1.0; Global Damping Multiplier (Shortcut to simultaneously rescale all six damping settings. Setting this to 1 means no adjustment to the values below [multiply by 1], reducing the damping can increase the response [and immersion] at the expense of oscillations. See individual damping settings for more information.); from 0 to 2.0, round to 0.01

[PITCH PHYSICS]
; Pitch-Axis Rotational Inertia

PITCH_ENABLED   = 1;   Enabled (Enables head nodding [pitch axis] inertia and dynamics, which helps stabilize your vision of the track.);   1 or 0
PITCH_FREQUENCY = 0.7; Stiffness (How stiff your neck is in this direction, specified as the resonance frequency of your head [Hz] -- above this frequency, vibrations from the car will be increasingly suppressed and the car will jitter around you more. Larger values will lock your head to the car, and smaller values will cause your view to lag behind the car more. Note this value is multiplied by the Global Stiffness Multiplier.); from 0.0 to 10, round to 0.1; only with PITCH_ENABLED
PITCH_DAMPING   = 1.0; Damping (How much your head oscillations are damped for this axis from 0 [oscillates indefinitely] to 1 [critically damped / no oscillation] and beyond. A real head will probably have damping around 0.85-0.95, and a drunk head will have a lower value, but setting this to 1 kills all oscillations and probably conveys the most reliable information about the car. However, values below 1 are more responsive, and can feel more immersive. Note this value is multiplied by the Global Damping Multiplier.); from 0 to 2, round to 0.01; only with PITCH_ENABLED
PITCH_LIMIT     = 30;  Limit (Maximum allowed rotation for this axis [degrees]. Up to half this value, the head dynamics are not affected, and beyond this, motion is "soft limited", ensuring the rotation is never farther than the specified value. Note this limit is only meant as a failsafe to prevent your from rolling in a weird way. To convey the most reliable information, it is best to use the scale, stiffness and damping to control the amplitude of motion.); from 0 to 90, round to 1; only with PITCH_ENABLED
PITCH_TRACKING  = 1;   Extra Eye Tracking (With this enabled, your vision will more tightly follow the car below the stiffness frequency and more strongly track the world above the stiffness frequency.

[YAW PHYSICS]
; Yaw-Axis Rotational Inertia

YAW_ENABLED   = 0; Enabled (Enables head turning [yaw] inertia and dynamics, which can reduce the vision wobble in turns as the car oscillates between gripped and ungripped. Many find this difficult to get used to [so it is disabled by default] but it can reduce motion sickness, and works especially well in VR.); 1 or 0
YAW_FREQUENCY = 1.5; Stiffness (How stiff your neck is in this direction, specified as the resonance frequency of your head [Hz] -- above this frequency, vibrations from the car will be increasingly suppressed and the car will jitter around you more. Larger values will lock your head to the car, and smaller values will cause your view to lag behind the car more.

[ADVANCED PARAMETERS]

ADVANCED_MODE = 0; Edit Advanced Parameters (DO NOT ADJUST UNLESS YOU ARE OK WITH WEIRD OR EXPERIMENTAL BEHAVIOR!! The settings below allow you to adjust some additional inner-workings of the physics engine. Note that disabling / unchecking this will only prevent editing the parameters, but will not disable their effect on the physics. You can always right-click to reset these to their default values if you do something weird. Some of these options technically break physics laws but may enhance the feel. Others make the head motion more realistic, but can cause motion sickness and / or spoil the road tracking. Note making head physics more realistic does not always produce a more true-to-life experience, since your eyes and inner ear do a lot of stabilization as well. Anyway, they are here to play with, so enjoy!); 1 or 0
